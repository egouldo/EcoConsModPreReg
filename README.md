# <%= title %> Format

Here we present a preregistration template for ecological models in ecology, conservation and related fields. This template is based on the EcoConsPreReg: A Guide to Adaptive Preregistration for Model-Based Research in Ecology and Conservation (v1.0.2) by Gould *et al.* (2024)[^1].

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template <egouldo>/<%= filesafename %>
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file containing the EcoConsPreReg template that you can use as a starting place for your preregistration.

## Using

*TODO*: Describe how to use your format.

## Format Options

*TODO*: If your format has options that can be set via document metadata, describe them.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [template.qmd](template.qmd).
